# time_freq
Time-frequency data for EEG analysis project

The data show time-frequency estimates (power) for alpha/ beta/ theta frequency bands

Plotted for all electrodes (64 Biosemi) x Trial time x Power

The experiment uses a pre-cueing paradigm in which a precue determines the type of object-directed hand action

Trial starts at -2 sec (precue time) until 0 sec at which the hand starts moving until +1.5 sec (action end)

# Precue values

*HP* = High predictable action (action 1 follows in 70 % of trials)

*LP* = Low predictable action (action 1/2 follow in 50 % of trials)

*UP* = Unpredicted action (action 2 follows in 30 % of trials)

*PN* = Predictable no-movement (action 3, no movement, follows in 100 % of trials)
